#Planning#
We as a group came up with several range of ideas and wanted to narrow down on a real word problem based on our experience.

We narrowed down our choices to providing a solution for parents who want to gather there kids for sporting events.

We drew sketches to communicate relationship to our models.

User
Event
RSVP

Drew our flow of how we want a user to interact with our application and what components could be rendered on the components.

#Technologies#
This application was built using MERN (Mongoose, Express, React, Node).

#Problem Solving#
One of the biggest things we did to solve problems was discussing and revisiting our drawings of flow and models. It always helps to have a second eye review the code also.

When making changes we communicated as a team and let eachother know what part we are working on so we wouldnt have multiple people on one specific section.
